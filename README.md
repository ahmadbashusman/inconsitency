# Update process vulnerabilities:

In the Inconsistency of Update-Related Vulnerabilitites


## 0. Overview:
This repository accompanies the artifacts of the research paper "UIn the Inconsistency of Update-Related Vulnerabilitites"
We present an emperical anaylsis of the inconsistency of  update process vulnerabilities in computing systmes.
## 1. Inconsistency of Selected Attributes (RQ1):
...
 
...

## 2. Inconsistency of Common Weaknesses (RQ2):
...
 
...



## Replicability

More details on the reason why we selected each and every idividual vulnerabitlies, and some statistical analysis can be found in the following file:


excel/dataset_sw.xlsx
excel/dataset_fw.xlsx


Still working on cleaning the repo.

More details on how to replicate this repo is on the way.
